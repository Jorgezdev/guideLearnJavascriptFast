This notebook is for anyone who wants to get started with JavaScript. It´s a quick guide, but it will also help you a lot to get started with this language as first bootcamp :)

JavaScript is an interpreted language, not compiled, meaning it reads code line by line.

Compiling takes the language to a middle ground where it communicates with the machine. A compiler takes the human-readable language, compiles it, and translates it for the machine.

JavaScript was created to run in a web browser.

It can also be used to create web apps, web servers, mobile apps, and desktop apps.

ECMA is responsible for standardizing the language so that all browsers have the same functionality.

JavaScript extensions used (in VsCode):

- Prettier (indents code with Ctrl+Shift+F)
- Bracket Pair Colorizer (colors code for better differentiation)
- Import Cost
- JavaScript ES6 Code Snippets (code shortcuts)
- Quokka.js (notifies you if your code is correct or not, helps preview it in the browser)
- Live Server (lets you view the project you're working on in the browser)
- indent-rainbow (colors indentation)
